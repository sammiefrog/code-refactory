## **Description**

For this project I was given an existing website and asked to make it accessible and clean up the code. I edited the html to fix broken links and add 'alt' attributes to all of the images. I also consolidated the CSS file and added comments explaining what each section contains.

I learned a great deal about accessibility standards and how to apply them to my work. I also learned how to make text resize when the browser window is resized, as well as how to use descriptive comments.
